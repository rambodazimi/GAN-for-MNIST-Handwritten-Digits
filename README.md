# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for MNIST Handwritten Digits

This repository contains a PyTorch-based implementation of a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** designed to generate realistic handwritten digit images from the MNIST dataset. GANs are a class of deep learning models consisting of two neural networks (a generator and a discriminator) that compete against each other in a zero-sum game, resulting in high-quality synthetic data generation.

#### Features:
- **Dataset:**
  - Utilizes the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits, consisting of 60,000 training and 10,000 testing images.

- **Model Architecture:**
  - **Generator**: Creates synthetic digit images by transforming random noise into structured data resembling MNIST digits.
  - **Discriminator**: Distinguishes between real images from the dataset and fake images generated by the generator.

- **Training Process:**
  - Adversarial training to optimize the generator and discriminator in tandem.
  - Binary cross-entropy loss for both networks.
  - Demonstrates techniques like alternating updates and balance in training dynamics.

- **Visualization:**
  - Displays generated images at various training steps to showcase the progression of the generator's capabilities.
  - Includes loss curves for both the generator and discriminator to analyze training performance.

- **Customization:**
  - Modular design for easy experimentation with different network architectures, hyperparameters, and optimization strategies.

#### How to Use:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gan-mnist.git
   ```
